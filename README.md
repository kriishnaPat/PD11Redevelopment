# PD11 Redevelopment
As a part of my first co-op work term I was able to aid in the redevelopment of Professional Development Course 11 at the University of Waterloo. I designed 10 compoenents, proceeded to develop 5 of them and was able to conduct mobile and browser testing for these components. 
These components follow WCAG 2.1 requirements and ensure interactivity for students. These were designed using figma, and built using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap.
